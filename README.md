# TypeScript Basics
TypeScript basic lessons I've learned

## Basic types
TypeScript supports much the same types as you would expected in JavaScript, with a convenient enumeration type thrown in to help things along.

## Interfaces
One of TypeScript's core principles is that type-checking focuses on the 'shape' that values have. This is sometimes called "duck typing" or "structural subtyping". In TypeScript, interfaces fill the role of naming these types, and are a powerful way of defining contracts within your code as well as contracts with code outside of your project. 

## Classes
Traditional JavaScript focuses on functions and prototype-based inheritance as the basic means of building up reusable components, but this may feel a bit awkward to programmers more comfortable with an object-oriented approach, where classes inherit functionality and objects are built from these classes. TypeScript allow developers to use OO techniques, and compile them down to JavaScript that works across all major browsers and platforms, without having to wait for the next version of JavaScript.
